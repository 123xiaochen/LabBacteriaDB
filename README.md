# LabBacteriaDB
In order to explore biosynthesis more comprehensively, we use the second-generation sequencing technology to sequence the soil microbial flora in nature and label the soil source, which constitutes a laboratory soil flora database. The database can expand existing resources to help researchers explore natural microorganisms more comprehensively.
